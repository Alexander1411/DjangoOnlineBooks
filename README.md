Django Online Bookstore 

This project is a fully functional Django-based online bookstore. Users can browse books, add them to their wishlist and shopping cart, proceed to checkout, and make purchases. The admin has the ability to manage books in the inventory. The application is designed with a focus on separation of concerns and user-friendly interaction, including features such as user registration, login, and profile management.
